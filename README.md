# Golang API on k3d

⚠️ This repository is currently under development.

Automation implementing [Building a TODO API in Golang with Kuberetes](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/building-a-todo-api-in-golang-with-kubernetes-1ec593f85029) by [Alex Ellis](https://alexellisuk.medium.com/).

I am creating this repository to teach myself the technologies used and to hopefully teach others who are just starting to learn DevOps and automation.
